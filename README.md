## RHEL-Edge Test Scope

RHEL for Edge test from QE is more like an integration test. The test flow aligns with the customer scenario. The whole test includes three parts:

1. RHEL for Edge image building with [osbuild-composer](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git)

    - Build RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 x86_64 images at OpenStack VM
    - Build CentOS Stream 8, CentOS Stream 9 and Fedora x86_64 images at Google Cloud VM
    - Build ARM images on bare metal ARM server or ARM VM at beaker

2. RHEL for Edge image installation

    - `edge-commit/iot-commit`: Setup HTTP server to serve as ostree repo, and HTTP boot to install with kickstart
    - `edge-container/iot-container`: Setup prod ostree repo, `edge-container/iot-container` as stage repo, and install with kickstart from prod ostree repo
    - `edge-installer/iot-installer`: Install from `edge-installer/iot-installer` ISO
    - `edge-raw-image/iot-raw-image`: Boot from raw image with KVM
    - `edge-simplified-installer`: Install from `edge-simplified-installer` ISO
    - `minimal-raw`: Boot from RPM based raw image with KVM
    - `edge-ami`: Image for AWS ec2 instance

3. RHEL for Edge system upgrade

    - Upgrade with the same OSTree ref
    - Rebase to a new OSTree ref
    - Upgrade from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9 or from CentOS Stream 8 to CentOS Stream 9

3. Checkings after installation/upgrade.

    - Check installed ostree commit
    - Check mount point
    - Check [`greenboot`](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot.git) services
    - Run container with `podman` (root and non-root)
    - Check persistent journal log
    - Check FDO onboarding and status (simplified-installer only)
    - Check LVM PV and LV, and check growfs (raw-image and simplified-installer only)
    - Check auto rollback with [`greenboot`](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot.git) when failure is detected
    - Check ignition configurations (raw-image and simplified-installer only)

## RHEL-Edge CI

### Upstream CI

For RHEL-Edge project, 90% of features come from [osbuild](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild.git) and [osbuild-composer](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git). In this case, [osbuild](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild.git) and [osbuild-composer](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git) CI will be used ad RHEL-Edge project upstream CI.

The Upstream CI is triggered by each PR and it focuses on code change.

Considering Upstream CI environment and test duration, the Upstream CI only covers virtualization tests, bare metal is out of Upstream CI scope.

### Test environment

#### For x86_64

You can run RHEL for Edge test on any x86_64 machine, like server, laptop, or VM, but KVM has to be enabled. Otherwise QEMU will be used and the test will take a really long time.

    $ls -l /dev/kvm

#### for ARM

To run RHEL for Edge test on ARM server, a bare metal ARM server is required.

#### Supported OS

    RHEL 8.6/8.8/8.9
    RHEL 9.0/9.2/9.3
    CentOS Stream 8
    CentOS Stream 9
    Fedora 37 (Simplified-installer not supported)
    Fedora 38 (Simplified-installer not supported)
    Fedora rawhide (Simplified-installer not supported)
