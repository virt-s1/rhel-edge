# RHEL-Edge Test

## Test Scenarios

1. Build RHEL Edge image on Openstack VM and install it on nested VM.
2. Build RHEL Edge image on OpenStack VM and install it on bare metal machine.

### Scenario 1

In this scenario, test code totally depdends on [upstream](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git).

Two test suites in scenario 1:

1. `ostree.sh`: For rhel-edge-commit(tar) image type on both RHEL 8.3 and RHEL 8.4
1. `ostree-ng.sh`: For rhel-edge-container(tar) and rhel-edge-installer(ISO) image types on both RHEL 8.4 only

#### Test environment prpare

1. You can run this scenario on any RHEL machine, like server, laptop, or VM, but KVM has to be enabled.

        $ls -l /dev/kvm

2. Required packages.

    - ansible
    - jq
    - expect
    - qemu-img
    - qemu-kvm
    - libvirt-client
    - libvirt-daemon-kvm
    - virt-install
    - python3-lxml

3. Clone upstream

    git clone -b rhel-8.4.0 https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git

4. Setup required file

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/libexec/osbuild-composer-test && sudo cp files/provision.sh /usr/libexec/osbuild-composer-test/provision.sh

### Scenario 2

In this scenario, environment setup and test running are based on Ansible playbook. This scenario is for RHEL 8.4 only.

1. The test runs on beaker because test needs bare metal machine. So keytab file is needed for beaker authentication.
2. The RHEL Edge image will be built on OpenStack VM, the encrypted OpenStack credential should be provided.

#### Test environment prpare

1. Required packages.

    - ansible
    - python3-lxml

2. Environment.

    - OpenStack credentials
    - Kerberos keytab file for beaker

## Run Test

### Scenario 1

    osbuild-composer/test/cases/ostree.sh
    osbuild-composer/test/cases/ostree-ng.sh

### Scenario 2

    $ARCH=x86_64 TEST_OS=rhel-8-4 ansible-playbook -v -i inventory ostree-bare.yml

## Configuration

You can set these environment variables to configure to run test

    TEST_OS        The OS to run the tests in.  Currently supported values:
                       "rhel-8-3"
                       "rhel-8-4"
    ARCH           The arch to build image and run test on.  Currently supported values:
                       "x86_64"
