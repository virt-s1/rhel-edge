# RHEL-Edge Test

RHEL-Edge help [documentation](HELP.md)

## RHEL-Edge Test Scope

RHEL for Edge test from QE is more like an integration test. The test flow aligns with the customer scenario. The whole test includes three parts:

1. RHEL for Edge image building with [image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git)

    - Build image at OpenStack VM - x86_64
    - Build image at Beaker server - aarch64

2. RHEL for Edge image installation and upgrade

    - `rhel-edge-commit`/`edge-commit`: Setup HTTP server to serve as ostree repo, and install with kickstart
    - `rhel-edge-container`/`edge-container`: Setup prod ostree repo, `rhel-edge-container`/`edge-container` as stage repo, and install with kickstart from prod ostree repo
    - `rhel-edge-installer`/`edge-installer`: Install from `rhel-edge-installer`/`edge-installer` ISO
    - `edge-raw-image`: Boot from raw image with KVM
    - `edge-simplified-installer`: Install from `edge-simplified-installer` ISO

3. checkings after installation/upgrade.

    - Check installed ostree commit
    - Check mount point
    - Check [`greenboot`](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot.git) services
    - Check auto rollback with [`greenboot`](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot.git) when failure is detected

## RHEL-Edge CI

### Upstream CI

For RHEL-Edge project, 90% of features come from [osbuild](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild.git) and [osbuild-composer](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git). In this case, [osbuild](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild.git) and [osbuild-composer](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer.git) CI will be used ad RHEL-Edge project upstream CI.

The Upstream CI is triggered by each PR and it focuses on code change.

Considering Upstream CI environment and test duration, the Upstream CI only covers virtualization tests, bare metal is out of Upstream CI scope.

### Downstream CI

The Downstream CI covers both virtualization and bare metal installation scenarios. Downstream CI is hosted by [Jenkins](https://jenkins-cloudci-prod-virt-qe-3rd.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/rhel-edge/job/rhel_edge_x86_64/) and triggered by RHEL 8 nightly compose.

The test result will be sent to Google Chat Room [RHEL-Edge Nightly CI Bot](https://chat.google.com/u/0/room/AAAAvEUnS8s). If you're interested downstream RHEL for Edge test result, please join this room.

### CI for this repository

CI for this repository is to test `test code`. It's triggered by PR in this repository. Any changes for `test code` has to be pass all tests of CI before they are merged into master. CI for this repository is hosted by [Jenkins](https://jenkins-cloudci-prod-virt-qe-3rd.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/Virt-S1/job/rhel-edge/view/change-requests/).

Test of this CI includes:

1. [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/): running as Github Action
2. [Yaml lint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): running as Github Action
3. Virt and bare metal tests: running on Jenkins

## RHEL-Edge Test Scenarios

1. Build RHEL Edge image on Openstack VM and install it on nested VM. Test covers both BIOS and UEFI installation.

2. Build RHEL Edge image on OpenStack VM and install it on bare metal machine.

### Scenario 1

Two test suites in scenario 1:

1. [`ostree.sh`](ostree.sh): rhel-edge-commit/edge-commit(tar) image type test on both RHEL 8.3 and RHEL 8.4
2. [`ostree-ng.sh`](ostree-ng.sh): rhel-edge-container/edge-container(tar) and rhel-edge-installer/edge-installer(ISO) image types test on RHEL 8.4 and later
3. [`ostree-raw-image.sh`](ostree-raw-image.sh): edge-raw-image image types test on RHEL 8.5 and later
4. [`ostree-simplified-installer.sh`](ostree-simplified-installer.sh): edge-simplified-installer image types test on RHEL 8.5 and later

#### Test environment prpare

1. You can run this scenario on any RHEL machine, like server, laptop, or VM, but KVM has to be enabled.

        $ls -l /dev/kvm

2. Required packages.

    - ansible
    - jq
    - qemu-img
    - qemu-kvm
    - libvirt-client
    - libvirt-daemon-kvm
    - virt-install

### Scenario 2

Test suite in scenario 2:

1. [`ostree-bare-ng.yml`](ostree-bare-ng.yml): rhel-edge-container/edge-container(tar) image type test

In this scenario, environment setup and test running are based on Ansible playbook. This scenario is for RHEL 8.4 only.

1. The test runs on beaker because test needs bare metal machine. So keytab file is needed for beaker authentication.
2. The RHEL Edge image will be built on OpenStack VM, the encrypted OpenStack credential should be provided.

#### Test environment prpare

1. Required packages.

    - ansible
    - python3-lxml
    - openstacksdk(pip)

2. Environment.

    - OpenStack credentials
    - Kerberos keytab file required by beaker

## Run Test

### Scenario 1

    $ ./ostree.sh
    $ OCP4_TOKEN=abcdefg QUAY_USERNAME=rhel-edge QUAY_PASSWORD=123456 ./ostree-ng.sh

    $ ./ostree-simplified-installer.sh

### Scenario 2

    $ ARCH=x86_64 TEST_OS=rhel-8-4 VAULT_PASSWORD=xxxxxxx ansible-playbook -v -i inventory ostree-bare-ng.yml
